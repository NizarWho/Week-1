# Week-1
Week 1 included the findamentals to coding;
Here are some notes that go along well with these mini projects:
          
      For printf, too, there are different placeholders for each type, called format codes:
      %c for chars
      %f for floats or doubles
      %i for ints
      %li for long integers
      %s for strings
      
      get_char
      get_double
      get_float
      get_int
      get_long
      get_string

      || is OR
      && equal to and
      "" is for string 
      ' is for char

      There are several mathematical operators we can use, too:
      + for addition
      - for subtraction
      * for multiplication
      / for division
      % for remainder
      
      bool, a Boolean expression of either true or false
      char, a single character like a 1  or 2
      double, a floating-point value with more digits than a float
      float, a floating-point value, or real number with a decimal value
      int, integers up to a certain size, or number of bits
      long, integers with more bits, so they can count higher than an int
      string, a string of characters
